## Romulus: Robust multi-state identification of transcription factor binding sites from DNase-seq data

Romulus is a computational method to accurately identify individual
transcription factor binding sites from genome sequence information and
cell-type--specific experimental data, such as DNase-seq. It combines the
strengths of its predecessors, CENTIPEDE and Wellington, while keeping
the number of free parameters in the model robustly low. The method is
unique in allowing for multiple binding states for a single transcription
factor, differing in their cut profile and overall number of DNase I cuts.
