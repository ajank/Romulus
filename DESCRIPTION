Description: Romulus is a computational method to accurately identify individual
    transcription factor binding sites from genome sequence information and
    cell-type--specific experimental data, such as DNase-seq. It combines the
    strengths of its predecessors, CENTIPEDE and Wellington, while keeping
    the number of free parameters in the model robustly low. The method is
    unique in allowing for multiple binding states for a single transcription
    factor, differing in their cut profile and overall number of DNase I cuts.
